# image_segmentation

Based on the article [Image segmentation with Neural Net](https://aboveintelligent.com/image-segmentation-with-neural-net-d5094d571b1e)

For now, this is a port of the FNC-16s models available at [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/#semantic-segmentation)

FNCs stands for 'Fully Convolutional Models for Semantic Segmentation', a [paper](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf) written by: Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer and Trevor Darrell, CVPR, 2015. [(code)](https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org)

These networks are trained on the PASCAL VOC 2011 training and (in part) validation data, using Berekely's extended annotations (SBD).
